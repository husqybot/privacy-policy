# Privacy policy for Husqy

Effective date: August 9th 2024

**Your Privacy Matters.**<br>
At Husqy, we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data Husqy (“the bot”, "us" or "we") collects from users (“you” or “your”), how we use it, and the measures we take to safeguard that data. By using our bot, you agree to the practices outlined in this policy.

## 1. Information we collect

We collect various types of data necessary for the proper functionality of our bot and all related services, such as (but not limited to):

- **_User data:_** Data related to users, such as (but not limited to), User IDs, Usernames, etc.
- **_ID's:_** Other ID's related to Discord, such as: Channel IDs, Role IDs, and Guild IDs.
- **_User provided data:_** Any information provided by users that is necessary for the bot’s functionality, such as command inputs or message content.
- **_Timestamps:_** When interactions with the bot occur, including commands and events.

All data is automatically collected during the use of our bot. The bot does not collect any personal information outside of what is necessary for its function.

## 2. How we use your data

We use the collected data to:

- Provide core functionality of the bot, including (but not limited to) responding to your messages and performing any commands that you request.
- Maintain and improve our bot's services, such as through the integration of a dashboard.

Data is processed solely for these purposes and is not used for advertising, profiling, or unrelated services. The bot does not share or sell your information with any third parties.

## 3. Data retention policy

We retain your data for as long as it is necessary for the proper functioning of our services. Some functionality may allow for a custom save duration for data related to that functionality, this custom duration is set by a server administrator.

Once the data is no longer needed or the set custom duration has ended, the data will be automatically deleted.

## 4. Third-Party Services

We may use third parties for hosting, authentication or other services needed for proper function of the bot. These third parties have their own privacy policy and data protection mechanisms, which you can refer to for more information about how they handle your data. Currently we make use of the following third parties:

- **_OVH:_** Our hosting provider and the place where data is stored.
- **_Discord:_** Authentication provider for user authentication on the dashboard.

## 5. Data Security

We take data security seriously and employ a range of measures to protect your data:

- All stored data is encrypted with a secure encryption mechanism where this is needed.
- Data is transmitted over secure channels using HTTPS to prevent unauthorized access.

Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and no one can guarantee absolute data security. You are also responible for the security of your own data within the bounds of our services, f.e. by ensuring you do not make you personal information available via the bot or its related services.

We continuously monitor our security practices to ensure they meet industry standards.

## 6. Legal Compliance

We strive to comply with relevant data protection regulations, including the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** to the best of our ability. As our bot evolves, we aim to ensure that all users' data is processed in a manner that adheres to applicable legal standards.

We do not knowingly collect data from users under the age of 13, and we do not process any sensitive personal information unless explicitly required for a feature. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that we have collected personal information from your child, please contact us immediately so that we can take appropriate action.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Privacy Policy. If we make any significant changes, we will notify users via Discord or update the effective date at the top of this document. Please check back periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.

Your continued use of the bot after the posting of any changes will constitute your acceptance of those changes.
