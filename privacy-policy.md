This privacy policy explains how Husqy (“the bot”, "us" or "we") collects, uses, and protects the information that it receives from users (“you” or “your”) who interact with the Bot on the Discord platform.

## Information collected by the bot
The bot collects information that is necessary for it to function properly, including your Discord ID, the contents of your messages, and any other data necessary to provide you with the Bot's services. The bot does not collect any personal information outside of what is necessary for its function.

## Use of information
The bot uses the information it collects solely to provide you with its services, including responding to your messages and performing any commands that you request. The bot does not share or sell your information with any third parties.

## Data retention
The bot retains your information for as long as necessary to provide its services to you. The bot may delete your information at any time upon your request, or if it is no longer necessary for the bot's function.

## Security measures
We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure, and the Bot cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Children's privacy
The bot does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that the Bot has collected personal information from your child, please contact us immediately so that we can take appropriate action.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on the bot's website or in the bot's Discord server, and your continued use of the bot after the posting of any changes will constitute your acceptance of those changes.

## Contact us
If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or the bot's use of your information, please contact us at support@husqy.xyz.
